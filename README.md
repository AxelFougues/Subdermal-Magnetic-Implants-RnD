# Subdermal-Magnetic-Implants-RnD
A collection of work on SMIs over the years including data, research, hardware and software development.
**Disclaimer: Nothing here is maintained or has been in years, some projects are unfinished and might even not run in newer environments. This repo is ment to be inspiration for future SMI tech. A ressource to look through when exploring SMIs. Please use my mistakes to anticipate yours.**

## Academic work



## SMIS: A unified ecosystem for SMI study and use
Designing consumer facing and easy to use tools for anallyzing and using SMIs in a unified and comparable manner. This project aims at creating both the devices and the mobile app that allow for a wide range of finger-magnet stimulation.
One core focus is to provide the implantees with a unified testing procedure for SMIs so that usable data can be produced in mass and therefore interesting analysis can be done both on the implant performace and the user's sensitivity.
A secondary goal is to discover and explore new uses for sensing by providing a convenient platform to do so. Some of these uses are sensory substitution through trainning, gamification of sensing (possibly spatial rendering of environments) and innovative human-machine interaction (notifications, gps directions... through sensing).

## BitSense Time Paradox
BitSense is in a way the ancestor to SMIS and was built with the premise of producing an induced SMI "sensing" maze game. Exploring the limitations of spatial hand/implant tracking and the rendering of spatial information to the implants through magnetic "sensing" signals. A POC of the game as well as a Toolkit were made in this project.
