# Subdermal-Magnetic-Implants-RnD
A collection of work on SMIs over the years including data, research, hardware and software development.
**Disclaimer: Nothing here is maintained or has been in years, some projects are unfinished and might even not run in newer environments. This repo is ment to be inspiration for future SMI tech. A ressource to look through when exploring SMIs. Please use my mistakes to anticipate yours.**

## Academic work
**Content of this repo**

Here you will find some resources extracted from a 6 month research work at CNRS IT lab LIRMM in Montpellier. This opportinity was given to me after presenting my home-research to Abderrahmane Kheddar (Haptics researcher). This work aims at better understanding the mechanics of "sensing", the feeling induced by magnetic fields to a person equiped with fingertip subdermal magnets.
In turn understanding and figuring out how to control this phenomenon allowed me to produce some interesting spatial haptic rendering as well as some texture and mechanical rendering such as pressing virtual buttons and distinguishing virtual surfaces.
There was an attempt at publishing such research but a combination of deadlines, life events, lack of test subjects other than myself and the difficulty of dealing with academic "ethical standards" resulted in no publication and many subjects left open to explore.




## SMIS: A unified ecosystem for SMI study and use
Designing consumer facing and easy to use tools for anallyzing and using SMIs in a unified and comparable manner. This project aims at creating both the devices and the mobile app that allow for a wide range of finger-magnet stimulation.
One core focus is to provide the implantees with a unified testing procedure for SMIs so that usable data can be produced in mass and therefore interesting analysis can be done both on the implant performace and the user's sensitivity.
A secondary goal is to discover and explore new uses for sensing by providing a convenient platform to do so. Some of these uses are sensory substitution through trainning, gamification of sensing (possibly spatial rendering of environments) and innovative human-machine interaction (notifications, gps directions... through sensing).

## BitSense Time Paradox
BitSense is in a way the ancestor to SMIS and was built with the premise of producing an induced SMI "sensing" maze game. Exploring the limitations of spatial hand/implant tracking and the rendering of spatial information to the implants through magnetic "sensing" signals. A POC of the game as well as a Toolkit were made in this project.
