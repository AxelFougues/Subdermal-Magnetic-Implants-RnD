Selection of the implant:
-omited importance of mass
-omited importance of coating/magnet ratio
Implantation:
-omited very long and variable time of encapsulation that can affect sensing (the author IH was implanted less than a year before the paper was published... but "As there was little difference
between the two implantees – results are given here merely for
the first recipient – JH.", interesting)


Proposed applications:
Ultrasonic navigation
Morse communication
