All current solutions involve a direct physical contact with the device in order to produce tactile stimuli (check for air displacement techniques).

The vast majority of current solutions invole mechanichal systems with moving parts and seem to be limited by the miniaturisation of parts and the uneven nature of the body's surface.

Those two concerns are theoreticaly completely eliminated with the magnetic field and SMI system.

However some systems have a detailed surface resolution (ex: pin matrix) and are capable therefore of simulating a texture or a displacement that a SMI could not.
