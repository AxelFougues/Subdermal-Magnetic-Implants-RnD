implanted vs not implanted

amplitude detection:
lowest threshold amplitude

amplitude discrimination:


frequency discrimination:
poor above 100Hz due to overlap of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscle range
Harmonics of complex waveforms

temporal discrimination:


temporal gap detection:
not affected by freq


coating? mass?
mass impacting vibration
healing durations
evolution of sensing over time
Why those freqs?
sensory substitution click
orientation/position of implanted magnets
1400W amplifier!?


positives: implanted -> noticably more sensitive to amplitude


A number of participants from both groups, including the
author, completed this experiment using a synesthetic like ability; in that
rather than just perceiving the vibrotactile stimuli, some commented that
they could hear the frequency change. The following quotes are from parti-
cipants while undergoing the experiment (N.B. these were entirely
unprompted):
“That’s weird I’m sort of hearing it” - I4RM
“It kinda feels like when a motor goes buzz or hmmm” - S5RM
“I turn the signal into sound” - I1LI.
While further discussion of these comments is omitted from this paper as it
did not fall immediately within the context of the research, its inclusion in this
section was thought to complement the quantifiable results.
