The visual one is unique in allowing a wide field of view and an access to fine spatial details. By contrast, tactile processing has a lower spatial bandwidth (e.g., Loomis, 1981). Such a large difference in spatial resolution between the two senses involved means that it might be impossible for touch to ever substitute for vision in complex real-world situations, such as driving a car or playing basketball.


The deeper resemblance between the acquisition of reading skills and the integration of sensory substitution devices comes from the fact that, in both cases, the progressive automatization of new identification skills consists in building a second route, which presupposes the existence of a first sensory route and parallels it.
